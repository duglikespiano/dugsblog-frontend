When configuring DNS, you will often encounter **A Records**, **CNAME**, and **ALIAS** records.  
They may look similar at first glance, but each serves a different purpose and has important limitations.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature             | A Record   | CNAME  | ALIAS                  |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| Points to           | IP address | Domain | Domain                 |
| Root domain allowed | ✅ Yes     | ❌ No  | ✅ Yes                 |
| Auto IP updates     | ❌ No      | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes                 |
| Extra DNS lookup    | ❌ No      | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (resolved early) |
| Standard DNS        | ✅ Yes     | ✅ Yes | ❌ Provider-specific   |

## A Record (Address Record)

Every server connected to the internet has an IP address.  
Computers communicate using these IP addresses, but they are difficult for humans to remember.

An A record solves this problem by mapping a domain name to an IP address.

```txt
example.com ➡️ 111.111.111.111

```

## CNAME(Canonical Name)

A CNAME record maps one domain to another domain.

It does not point directly to an IP address.
Instead, it acts like a nickname for the target domain.

Because of this, it automatically follows IP changes.
However, it cannot be used on the root domain `example.com` in standard DNS.

```txt
www.example.com ➡️ example.com
```

## ALIAS

An ALIAS record behaves similarly to a CNAME, but the DNS provider resolves the target domain before responding to the client.

As a result, the client receives an IP address directly instead of another domain name.

An ALIAS record points to a domain name and can be used on root domains (such as `example.com`).

Because ALIAS is not part of the official DNS standard, it is a provider-specific feature and is only available on certain DNS services.

```txt
example.com ➡️ myapp.hosting-provider.com
```
