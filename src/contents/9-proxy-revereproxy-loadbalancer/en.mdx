When building or operating web systems, you will often hear the terms **proxy**, **reverse proxy**, and **load balancer**.

They sound similar, and in practice they sometimes overlap, but they solve different problems and sit at different positions in a network architecture.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature           | Proxy                   | Reverse Proxy              | Load Balancer         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Who it represents | Client                  | Server                     | Server group          |
| Position          | Client side             | Server side                | Server side           |
| Main purpose      | Control outbound access | Protect & optimize servers | Distribute traffic    |
| Hides             | Client identity         | Server details             | Backend servers       |
| Typical use case  | Company network, VPN    | Web servers, APIs          | High-traffic services |

## Proxy

A proxy sits between the client and the internet.

Instead of the client directly accessing a server, the request goes through the proxy first.

### What problem does it solve?

- Hide the client’s real IP address
- Restrict or filter outbound access
- Cache responses to reduce bandwidth usage

Client ➡️ Proxy ➡️ Internet
```

## Reverse Proxy

A reverse proxy sits in front of servers, facing the internet.

Clients think they are talking to the server directly, but they are actually talking to the reverse proxy.

### What problem does it solve?

- Hide internal server structure
- Centralize TLS (HTTPS) handling
- Cache responses
- Apply security rules (rate limiting, IP blocking)

```txt
Client ➡️ Reverse Proxy ➡️ Server
```

## Load Balancer

A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers.

It ensures that no single server becomes a bottleneck.

### What problem does it solve?

- Handle high traffic
- Improve availability
- Enable horizontal scaling

```txt
Client
  ➡️ Load Balancer
    ➡️ Server A
    ➡️ Server B
    ➡️ Server C
```

<img src={loadBalancer.src} className="mx-auto w-full max-w-[500px]" alt="loadbalancer" />

## How They Work Together

```txt
Client
  ➡️ Reverse Proxy
    ➡️ Load Balancer
      ➡️ App Server 1
      ➡️ App Server 2
      ➡️ App Server 3
```
