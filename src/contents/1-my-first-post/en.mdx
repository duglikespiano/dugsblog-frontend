### Another beginning

My long time blog page building has been finished finally. Even if building is over, I am about to 'start' to note my thoughts. Although not many people are visiting, I am still shy to record and my thought publicly. but yeah, it probably is also a new beginning.

Personally I think one of the critical abilities for my career is, 'Expressing my own thoughts in orginazed way'. Unfortunately, I don't think I deliver my thoughts properly. Yeah, I am sure that I am writing this post for two hours.

It doesn't matter whether it takes an hour or two. What matters is that with every effort I make, I'll grow and improve with each passing dayâ€”I'm certain of it. I, who couldn't debug even a simple CSS and now operate this page by my everyday effort.

Every start comes with a face of excitement. Yet before you know it, you find yourself weighed down by uncertainty and wounded by the sting of your own inexperience.

I am sure I will face those painful periods. I am alright. Excitement, delightment, sadness, scars on my heart are all parts of my precious life.

Which road will I walk ahead? I am just excited of it.
