### Another begin

My long time blog page building has been finished finally. Even if building is over, I am about to 'start' to note my thoughts. Although no many people are visiting, I am still shy to record and my thought publicly. but yeah, it probably is also a new beginning.

Personally I think one of the critical ability for career is, 'Express own thoughts in orginazed and proper way'. Unfortunately, I don't think I deliver my thought efficiently. yeah, I am sure that I am writing this post for two hours.

It doesn't matter whether it takes an hour or two. What matters is that with every effort you make, I'll grow and improve with each passing dayâ€”I'm certain of it. I who couldn't debug even simple CSS, now can operate these page by everyday's effort.

Every moments of start comes with face of excitement. Yet before you know it, you find yourself weighed down by uncertainty and wounded by the sting of your own inexperience.

I am sure that I will face those painful period. I am alright. Excitement, delightment, sadness, scars on my heart are all parts of my precious life.

Which road will I walk along ahead? I am just excited of it.
